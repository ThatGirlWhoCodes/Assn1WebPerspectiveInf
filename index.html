        <b>The arise of human-created AI has shown us that it has capabilities we didnt think were possible (via a bot). But what are those capabilities and does AI have the power to cut designers jobs out and have brands and business owners relying on them? We will have to see. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I appreciate the analogy and comparison to Friedrich Nietzsche statement: <q>God is dead. He remains dead. And we have killed him.</q> (1), I do not subscribe to using his name in vain and certainly dont particularly like Nietzsche profound opinion in itself. Again, with this, I appreciate the connection of an analogy to the problem at hand and does explain the double-edged sword we are dealing with now that is AI. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, AI has taken our society by storm, and not just designers, EVERYONE! For instance, my boss (entrepreneur) uses Chat GPT to regulate a schedule for us employees, or maybe to brainstorm caption ideas for a social media post. This may sound mundane or frivolous, however its important to highlight that AI caters to (almost) all professions. As a junior designer, I can see both the positive and negatives that conversational interfaces are bringing to the zeitgeist. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Design does not have a <q>one-size-fits-all definition</q>(2). The fundamental purpose of design <q>is to solve problems by improving user experiences.</q>, (2) and this concept, will not go anywhere. If you typed into an AI and asked to create a design for your brand, it would. However, does it provoke emotion? Does it create a sense of community?  We are still answering this question, although, I believe the answer to be no.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Design has, and always will carry an important and intimate role in our lives. Whether that is a warning sign on the side of the street telling us to be careful, a <em> cool looking </em> protein bar package, or the need to find the best black tea. All these simple tasks have been one in the same regarding design. AI may be able to produce cool designs to the regular eye, however us designers know better. We know that we may find inspiration, but we dont rely on AI to start and finish a project.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what I mean when I say AI is a double-edged sword because, like everything, there are positives and negatives. And recognizing those pros and cons is imperative when using AI as a tool. Especially as a creative, being able to recognize an AI result and be equipped enough to know what things to use, what things to change, etc.. The repercussions of not, is having a product with bad UX and connection to user.  
    </p>
    <p>
        With everyone fearful of the unknown with AI, I suggest we all focus on the positives and capitalize on those to aid in your design process. Rather than engaging in the negatives and being stuck in a constant, almost like creatives-block (my version of writers block for designers). 
    </p>
    <p>
        To close, <q>It would be arrogant and ignorant to believe that AI cant take over our jobs.</q> (3). AI is a scary thing to think about, but to assume a system like this would take over a whole profession is absurd. <q>the traditional notion of design may eventually become obsolete.</q> (4) but design itself will never be obsolete.
